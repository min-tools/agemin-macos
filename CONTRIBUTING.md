# Contributing to Agemin

You can help by reporting a clear bug, adding or improving a translation, reviewing a change, or contributing code. Source builds keep the same trial and Free tier limits as the Mac App Store build.

- Check [existing issues](https://github.com/min-tools/agemin-macos/issues) before opening a new one.
- For bugs, include the app and macOS versions, the kind of key involved, and clear steps to reproduce. Never attach private keys, passphrases, or the files you encrypted. A public key or a small test file encrypted for a throwaway key is fine.
- Discuss larger changes in an issue first. Keep pull requests focused and explain what changes for the user.
- Follow [Build and test](docs/development.md) and include the relevant test results in your pull request. Changes to the age implementation must keep `scripts/test_age_core.py` passing, including its checks against the `age` command line tool when it is installed.
- Do not commit local builds, app bundles, archives, installers, signing files, or local configuration. Keep generated output in `build/` or `dist/`, which git ignores.
- Keep comments and documentation accurate, short, and easy to read.

## Contribution terms

These terms apply to code, documentation, artwork, translations, and other material intentionally submitted for inclusion in Agemin through its official repository (a **Contribution**). Material clearly marked in writing as "Not a Contribution" is excluded.

These terms form a separate contributor license agreement between you and the Project Owner. They supersede the repository license for your Contribution where the terms differ. By submitting a Contribution, you agree to the following terms:

1. **Authority.** You represent that you created the Contribution or otherwise have the legal right to submit it and grant these licenses. If an employer or another person or entity may own rights in it, you represent that you have obtained their permission. You must identify any third-party material and its license.
2. **Copyright license.** You grant Ilia Ross (the **Project Owner**) a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, transferable, and sublicensable copyright license to use, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works from, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and otherwise make the Contribution available, in source or object form, alone or with other material, for any purpose and under any license or other terms, with or without attribution.
3. **Patent license.** You grant the Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, transferable, and sublicensable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution and works that include it. This license applies only to patent claims you can license that are necessarily infringed by the Contribution alone or by its combination with Agemin as submitted.
4. **Moral rights.** To the extent the law permits, you waive and agree not to assert moral rights in the Contribution against the Project Owner or anyone receiving rights from the Project Owner.
5. **Ownership and payment.** You retain ownership of your Contribution. This is a license, not a copyright assignment. You submit it without an expectation of payment, and the Project Owner is not required to accept or use it.

The additional contribution permission in [LICENSE](LICENSE) permits the copying, modification, and publication needed to prepare and submit a Contribution. It does not permit any other distribution of Agemin or modified versions.
